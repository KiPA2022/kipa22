# Baselines

This is a depository for the officially implemented baseline models and the connections of excellent segmentation framework published by third parties.

## Officially implemented baselines
The baselines in this folder will be gradually improved, and the existing codes include:
- [DenseBiasNet](https://github.com/YutingHe-list/DenseBiasNet-pytorch) and its variants [[paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841520300864)]
- [MNet](https://github.com/zfdong-code/MNet)
- 3D U-Net[[paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46723-8_49)]
- ...

## Enviroment and requirement
- python 3.7+
- SimpleITK 2.0.2
- Pytorch 1.7+
- batchgenerators 0.23
