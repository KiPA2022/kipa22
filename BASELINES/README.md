This is a depository for the officially implemented baseline models and the connections of excellent segmentation framework published by third parties.

## Officially implemented baselines
The baselines in this folder will be gradually improved, and the existing codes include:
- The [code](https://github.com/YutingHe-list/DenseBiasNet-pytorch) of [DenseBiasNet and its variants](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841520300864)
- ...

## Enviroment and requirement
- python 3.7+
