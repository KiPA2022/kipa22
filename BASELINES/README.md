# Baselines

This is a depository for the officially implemented baseline models and the connections of excellent segmentation framework published by third parties.

## Officially implemented baselines
The baselines in this folder will be gradually improved, and the existing codes include:
- [DenseBiasNet and its variants](https://github.com/YutingHe-list/DenseBiasNet-pytorch) [[paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841520300864)]
- ...

## Enviroment and requirement
- python 3.7+
- SimpleITK 2.0.2
- Pytorch 1.7+
- batchgenerators 0.23

## Third party baselines
- [nnUNet](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet)
- [V-Net](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/blob/dev/monai/networks/nets/vnet.py)
- [DeepLab](https://github.com/jfzhang95/pytorch-deeplab-xception)
