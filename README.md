# Official repository of MICCAI 2022 Challenge: [KiPA22](https://kipa22.grand-challenge.org/).

We provide the evaluation code and a [BASELINE depository] for a simple start of our challenge. You can use the code in `EVALUATION` to evaluate the `DSC`, `HD`, and `AVD` of your result, and use the code in `BASELINES` to strat your KiPA22.

Please feel free to raise any issues if you have questions about the challenge, e.g., dataset, evaluation measures, ranking scheme and so on.
